title: "Submitting to snippets-2019"
---

We really hope that you will share your best code snippets and examples with your fellow students. This could both be code directly related to solving the problem sets, or other examples you believe your fellow students could benefit from seeing. This guide shows you how to submit your code to the [snippets-2019](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/snippets-2019) repository, which has been created for sharing code in this course.

> **Note:** The best submissions to [snippets-2019](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/snippets-2019) can later be added to the [NumEcon-package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/NumEcon).

### Submitting: Forking and making a pull request

At GitHub you're able to fork any public repository that you don't own. Basically, a fork is a copy of an another persons or organizations repository where you can commit to the project. Not only, are you able to commit to the project, but you can also make a suggestion to the owner of the repository to include your changes or additions to the project. 

First, I'll show how to fork the snippets-2019 repository and a new `.py` file (in practice you should add notebooks, see below). The next things that happens is that I clone the forked repository to my local computer, and open it in Visual Studio Code. I then create the new `.py` file and commit the changes and sync with GitHub. Then GitHub tells me that my forked repository is ahead of the original repository, and asks if I want to create a pull request which I do. Then the owner can include the changes into the original repository. (I am directly able to do so because I have owner permission over the repository on GitHub).

### Step-by-step guide

This is basically how you provide changes to any software project on GitHub: 

1. Fork the original repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Make changes, add files, delete files
4. Commit the changes with meaningful commit messages
5. Sync the commits to GitHub
6. Go to the forked repository 
7. Create a pull request with a meaningful explanation

### Notebooks

The best way to contribute to [snippets-2019](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/snippets-2019) is by creating notebooks with code and examples of how to use it. See the `Simulating the Solow mode.ipynb` notebook ([link](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/snippets-2019/blob/master/Simulating%20the%20Solow%20model.ipynb)) for the template you should follow.
