title: "Asking questions using GitHub Issues"
---

&nbsp;

If you have a question, always try to find an answer by searching on Google first, [see this guide](/guides/searching). If you can still not find an answer, you can ask it in the course forum using a _GitHub Issue_. Basically, a _GitHub Issue_ is a way of communicating a bug, request or something else related to a specific project hosted on GitHub.

### Creating a new issue

&nbsp;

To create a _GitHub Issue_ follow these steps:

1. Go to the lectures repository at https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/lectures-2020.
2. In the repositories navigation bar click on the banner named _Issues_.
3. Click on _New Issue_.
4. Give the issue an appropriate name so it is clear to other people what the issue is about.
5. Explain your problem as simply as possible.
