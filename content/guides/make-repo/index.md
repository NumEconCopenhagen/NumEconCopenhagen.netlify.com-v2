### Create your first repository

<br /> Follow the steps below to create your own repository in the Github Classroom that we use to organize all group work in this course. 

&nbsp;

#### 1. If you are the creator of the repository:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Follow [this invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/g/AntGyHF2) to create a group repo in class 2022
3. Create a new team - see bottom of page. Provide the name you want for the team - this will be your permanent group name. 
4. Click **Create team** and wait a moment or two.
5. Now your team's repo has been created following a template design that everyone should use. And you are the only member so far.

#### 2. If a group member has already created your team/repository:  

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and sign in
2. Follow [this invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/g/AntGyHF2) to see all teams in the current class.
3. Find your specific group.
4. Click join group.
5. You are now a group member. (Note: each group can at most have 3 members) 

&nbsp;

#### 3. You can also **invite** members to you team:

1. Go to your repository page
2. Go to **Settings** 
3. Choose **Manage access** in the left pane
4. Click the green button **Invite teams or people** 
5. Search for your team members by their Github id.

Note: using the template will ensure that you have a .gitignore file and that you are under the MIT open access license.
